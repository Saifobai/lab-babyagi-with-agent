By KNOWING your target audience ! The more homework you do on understanding and researching upon your target audience, the more clarity you shall receive in terms of ‘finding a voice’ for your brand. For e.g., Who is your product for ? What problem is it helping solve ? Who is your ideal customer ? How does your ideal customer feel, think, believe ? What do they desire ? And where do they spend their quality time ? Which place, which platform and with whom ? Once you figure out these questions, you shall be absolutely able to find the right ‘tone for your brand’. For example, your product is related to cricket and your target audience is the niche of cricket lovers. In this case, the ‘tone of the brand’ cannot be too tender and soft (unlike in a baby food brand), the tone here has to resonate the sporty vibes of the game.
